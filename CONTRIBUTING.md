# Contributing to Flow Core

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Flow Core as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows our coding standards
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Standards

- Use C++20 features appropriately
- Follow the existing code style
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Document new code using Doxygen-style comments
- Include unit tests for new features

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.

## Bug Reports

Please use the GitHub issue tracker and include:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the docs/ with relevant documentation
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
